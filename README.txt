Raduga, the app that predicts rainbows over Russia
---------------------------------------------------

Pink Pony Express & Club Interbellum present a meteorological protest.

In June 2013, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a law banning propaganda
for non-traditional sexual relations. As a result, the rainbow is disappearing
from the streets of Russia. We are introducing the app Raduga, enabling the
masses to spot and capture rainbows everywhere.

Raduga is an interactive mobile app that uses live satellite data to predict
the formation of rainbows, and sends you an alert when rainbows are in the
neighborhood. Users can upload and share their own rainbow photos via social
media, to show that rainbows are here to stay.

The app is made with Appcelerator Titanium, which one needs to install on one’s
computer if one wants to run this source code.

Raduga also makes use of serverside components available here:

Finally, Raduga makes use of Appcelerator’s Cloud Services for user management
(the required keys can be added to the tiapp.xml file).
To set up all these components may proove cumbersome; but quite a part of the
functionality is already available when the user is offline.
